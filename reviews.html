  <p id="text"> It's like all those anime with overpowered protagonists<br>Except you're not the protagonist" - slime from STEAM REVIEWS.</p>

   <p id="text"> "When you get parried by a headless skeleton not once but twice, you start to question your life choices.<br>Lucky this game is so visually beautiful that all the skeletons in the game won't stop you from coming back to die again and again " - Lady S. from STEAM REVIEWS</p> 
    <p id="text"> "This game is one of my favourite rpg, atleast top 5. The devs really combined all their experiences of the previous games and made something that even people who are knew to the series can master. Also after playing the souls series I can't scratch the boss fight itch, all other games bosses seem under powered and boring. The pvp is also another fun element in this game while I was playing and had nearly no healing item left and a player invaded my game and yet I still overcame it felt so good. Once you go souls series you never go back it is one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming when you finally get through it." - Eesa Kamaldien from GOOGLE REVIEWS.</p>
